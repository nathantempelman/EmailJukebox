EmailJukebox
============

A little application I threw together one morning. Basically just the title.

This simple program was the final blow in a short lived prankwar with my roommate. It sends all the lyrics 
of a song to an email address of your specification, one email per line of song. Funny in moderation.

It uses a simple smtp client to automate the sending of a bunch of emails. It requires a gmail address.

The song choice is limited to Rick Astley's Never Gonna Give You Up and Lionel Richie's Hello, but adding more 
songs would be trivial.
